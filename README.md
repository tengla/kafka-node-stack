Simple docker stack showing how to create a topic, produce messages within
that topic and balance them with 2 partitions, and then
finally consume messages on topic partitions with 2 instances.

source the scripts:
```
source scripts.sh
```

To start the thing:
```
deploy
```

To tear down and clean up:
```
